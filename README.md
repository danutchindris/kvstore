# kvstore

## Erlang Accelerator Sessions Coding Challenge

Write an Erlang module that implements a simple key-value store with the following requirements:
- Use a map as the main storage.
- Provide functions to add, update, remove, and fetch keys.
- Support listing all keys in sorted order (demonstrating type ordering).
- Bonus: Add a counter using atomics to track the number of operations performed.

Provide REPL examples for each operation.
